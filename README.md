# WDM-Linux-PS3
A required project that I am going to start in November of 2025, and release on January 3, 2028. It will be made to help preserve the life of your console during its whole development which will last for all of mankind. Based on PS3 XMB, Debian, and Android.
You will still be able to use your Sony PS3 like normal, and have 2 new OS compatibility modes that are: Android (Oreo) (V1.0 - V1.9.9), and Debian (64 bit). You're welcome.游때游때游때游때游때游때游때游때
